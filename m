Not sure, but I have some patches that I was planning to send
that puts these into arch/*/kernel/Makefile.syscalls for all
architectures in a consistent way. Ideally we'd use the same
Makefile contents for tools/perf in order to trivially sync
them, but I'm also happy to hear other suggestions.

Your patches are currently ahead of mine, so I don't want to
hold you up.=20

Yes, this is also something I've been trying to work on. In particular
the calling conventions for 64-bit register arguments on 32-bit
targets need some help. My plan for this is to have a consistent
mapping of internal (sys_foo()) function names to argument lists,
instead of having some calls that are slightly different depending
on the architecture or ABI.

This should be in a machine-readable format so it can be parsed
not only by perf but also any other project that needs a list
(libc, gdb, qemu, strace, rust, ...)

I think the way it actually works on mips is that all syscalls are
allowed in any task and the actual number identifies both the
ABI and the syscall. In some variant, the same is true on arm
(oabi/eabi) and x86-64 (64/x32), but oabi and x32 are both too
obsolete to put much work into them.

There is still some interest in mips, maybe you can poke the
maintainers and see if someone is willing to help out since you
have done the bulk of the work already.

I also remembered that I had a patch to bring the s390 syscall.tbl
into the same format as the others, since the behavior is currently
a bit different for compat calls. I think there is also a chance
that they want to discontinue 32-bit mode entirely, given that
the last 32-bit machine was discontinued over 20 years ago, and
support for native 32-bit kernels got removed 10 years ago
after Debian 8 moved to 64 bit.

If they are confident that there are no more remaining users that
rely on 32-bit binaries, we could both save some work.

I would probably document it in the file as an intentional
omission, same as for arm oabi

There are a handful of people still testing it, and some still
using it, but I agree it completely failed to get enough
traction to be worth maintaining.

I view x32 (and the corresponding arm64 ilp32 mode that never
made it in) mostly as an exercise in benchmark(et)ing, since
it showed noticeably higher results in some versions of specint
and some compiler workloads, compared to both normal 32-bit and
64-bit modes. The time that we already wasted on maintaining
it must have long surpassed any such benefits though, so I
certainly don't want to waste more time on it.
