Yes, I can understand why you be opposed to that and I don't have a good
counterargument.

Maybe it is brittle? It could be mapped to e_machine, but that just
might not be reasonable to work into the method from my patch.

Thanks for elaborating on this! I do wish we had more of this
conversation on the original patch so we could have molded the original
patch closer to what this one is doing. I know you did mention you would
like to get rid of the arch directory as feedback on that patch but I
hadn't realized that this was the direction you were hoping to take
this. It does seem like the changes you have made in this patch will
lead to a something that is more robust and simpler to maintain, so we
can move forward with reviewing this patch and stop reviewing the one I
wrote.
